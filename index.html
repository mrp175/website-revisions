            Hi, I’m Ptolemy. That's me in the red. Welcome to my one page website as part of my application for Founders and Coders. This website was created using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. Please have a look round. I've included my image carousel, some interesting projects that I have worked on in recent years, as well as some of my more recent music compositions. You can find links to my freeCodeCamp, Codewars, GitHub, Codepen and SoundCloud in the footer of this page. 
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            You can find the GitHub repo for this website <a href="https://github.com/mrp175/mrp175.github.io">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            I have really enojoyed working on this site. It is by no means finished, although enough for my application to Founders and Coders I hope. I intend to include more content and functionality in the future.

            After finishing my degree in music and sound technology, I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do with my life. Originally, I wanted to be the next super star DJ, but, I also didn't want to put all my eggs in one basket - so I've found a "proper" job to keep me going in the meantime. Whilst my love for music lives on, I found that helping others can be incredibly rewarding too, so started working for the NHS at the Gender Identity Development Service in 2016. It is a highly specialised clinic for young people who are struggling with their gender identity. It's an incredible place to work, with a great and diverse team who all work incredibly hard to support young people who are navigating new and often difficult choices. I find this field fascinating and absolutely take pride in my contribution to the help that we provide as well as the progress that we have collectively made in recent years. However, more and more recently, I have really been looking for something that will challenge me on a more creative and technical level.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">

            Having made music for the past 15 years in my spare time has been my outlet for this, but since finding Founders and Coders and having so much fun working through the prerequisites, and seeing what is possible with a bit of technical know how, I am hoping to get on the course and am ultimately really looking forward to starting a career in web development!

        <div class="text-border-main">

          <p class="card-text">
            Whilst I love what I do, I recognise that there is a lot of room for improvement. My philosophy revolves around three key principles: 
          </p>

          <ul class="card-text">
            <li> Leave the world in a better state than you found it (cliché, I know!) </li>
            <li> Dare to dream - be curious </li>
            <li> Move out of my comfort zone and GROW! </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="card-text"> 
            To that effect, I have worked hard to try and foster these seminal technical skills so that I can start to peel back the layers around what technology is, and what it can do for our planet. I also found that I share the same passion and enthusiasm for coding as I do for music. And finally, I recognise that “tech”, as big a field as it is, is all about problem solving, on a massive scale.  But this is just the beginning for me, and I want to push this further. So I have a few goals that I’d like to work on.
          </p>


          <p class="card-text">

           <b> I want to become technically competent </b> with modern web technologies. I’m really keen to understand how the simple building blocks of HTML, CSS and Javascript can be mixed together to create new experiences and even change lives. I want to be a part of this force for change as our world becomes ever more digitalised. 

         </p>

         <p class="card-text">

           <b> I want to put my creativity to its best use and maximise its potential. </b> As a musician and someone who has spent the last 15 years focussing relentlessly on creating personal masterpieces, I have a keen eye for detail. I’ve found whilst making this website, that It’s not just sound or music that I’ve started to pay attention to - visuals and aesthetics are important too! I believe that a job in technology could give me a vital new creative outlet, and I’m looking forward to the challenges that brings.

         </p>

         <p class="card-text"> <b> I want to be less afraid of failure. </b> This is something I have really struggled with, and I know from my friends that in the tech world, more and more we embrace failure as part of the road to success. This is a very personal goal for me, but being more confident and less afraid of failure would help me achieve so much more, for others and for myself.

        Music has been a big part of my life since I was around 12 or 13. My brother showed my some of his drum and bass vinyls and I was hooked. I Shortly after that I was given a copy of Reason 2.5 for my birthday, so I got to work and haven't stopped since. It's a great outlet for my creativity and gives me the opportunity to build (what I would consider) complex and technically impressive works. Each new song is like solving a puzzle. You need to know what elements to add, and how to do that. Both are things that I still struggle with to this day.
